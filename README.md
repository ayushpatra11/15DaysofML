# 15DaysofML
 Taking up the challenge to dive deeper in the into the domain of Machine Learning.
 
 I had done a few online coursera courses by Andrew Ng, however, this was the first time I used my knowledge to get an output practically. 
 
 Day 1: Imported a dataset and observed the data manually by finding the datatype of each column. 
 
 Day 2: Used the drop function in pandas library to drop the columns which are not of type int or float
 
 Day 3: Plotted distplots and boxplots using seaborn
 
 Day 4: Observing each plot and comparing the values of each column  with respect to label.
 
 Day 5: Finding the skewness of each column by observing the plotted graphs
 
 Day 6: Categorising each column into normal, left or right skewed column.
 
 Day 7: Using this information, with some help, I applied mathematical functions on the columns reduce their skewness.
 
 Day 8- Day 15: Worked with a few classmates on a project on Intrusion Detection. The work was divided among 4 people and we achieved an accuracy of 87.7% on teh test set. To learn more, I also attended an online course on Machine Learning by Henry Harvin Education.
